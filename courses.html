                        bringing new ideas to market. Students will understand the entrepreneurial business process and
                        how
                        they
                        might become involved in those processes in their future careers--in whatever direction those
                        careers
                        might lead. This class will explore the structure and framework of entrepreneurial
                        endeavors--both
                        inside and outside the business world. The course will answer questions such as: What is
                        entrepreneurship? What is opportunity recognition and selection? How can you create and define
                        competitive advantage? How can you think about people in the entrepreneurial context? How can
                        you
                        garner
                        support (financial and other) for an entrepreneurial venture? What do you do when nothing works
                        as
                        planned? And, how do you focus on doing right and doing well?
