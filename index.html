         &emsp; Hello, my name is Trevor Cox. I'm a self-appointed creative, wannabe skater, and a Long Island wise guy.
         In 2015, I graduated from Roslyn High School in suburban purgatoria. After that, I went to UC Berkeley 🐻,
         where I majored in Computer Science. I also took a bunch of other <a
            href="./courses.html">courses</a> to feed my intellectural hunger. After 3.5 years, I graduated and started
         working at a small startup called test.io, which was eventually acquired by EPAM Systems.
         <br><br>
         &emsp; Inspired by my uncle's service with the Peace Corps in El Salvador 🇸🇻, I applied to a volunteer
         teaching position in Kenya 🇰🇪. Then COVID hit. The Peace Corps evacuated thousands of volunteers from dozens of
         countries, and my status was in limbo. I decided to seize this opportunity to do something I had always wanted
         to try: teach 4 year old tykes how to shred black diamonds ⛷️. I packed up my off-white 1999 Audi A6 station
         wagon and left the Bay Area for Sun Valley, Idaho 🌄.
         <br><br>

         <br>
         &emsp; I worked as a ski instructor for two winters and
         taught people age 3 to 63 the beauty and joy of skiing. In the summers, I would return to California to work as
         a head cook at a summer camp in the Sierra Nevadas 🏔. After two seasons in each locale, my itinerant life
         came to an end, and I finally departed for the Peace Corps in October 2022.
         <br><br>
         &emsp; For the next two years, I worked as a secondary school teacher in a rural Kenyan school, where I taught
         math, computers, and life skills. I learned Swahili, cooked ugali, and used a squat toilet 💩. I also
         collaborated with local partners to write and implement two grants, totaling about $18,000. This money was used
         to build a computer lab for our school 🖥 🖨 🖱 ⌨. For more details, see <a href="./peacecorps.html">Newsletter
            no.9</a>.
         <br><br>
         &emsp; This is a place for me to post my writings and mess around with code. In college I barely touched HTML, 
         CSS, and JS so pardon any mistakes. This website is a Frankenstein's monster of
         code from Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, and code taken from my friend Frank's website. Check him out at: <a href="http://www.fjlin.me">fjlin.me</a>.
