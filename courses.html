                <p><strong>UGBA C5</strong> (Introduction to Entrepreneurship) | This course is designed for freshmen
                    and
                    sophomores who wish to know about entrepreneurship, its importance to our society, and its role in
                    bringing new ideas to market. Students will understand the entrepreneurial business process and how
                    they
                    might become involved in those processes in their future careers--in whatever direction those
                    careers
                    might lead. This class will explore the structure and framework of entrepreneurial endeavors--both
                    inside and outside the business world. The course will answer questions such as: What is
                    entrepreneurship? What is opportunity recognition and selection? How can you create and define
                    competitive advantage? How can you think about people in the entrepreneurial context? How can you
                    garner
                    support (financial and other) for an entrepreneurial venture? What do you do when nothing works as
                    planned? And, how do you focus on doing right and doing well?
