                        introduction to the politics and comparative study of international development, both human and
                        economic. A central question will help organize the course: why have some countries developed
                        successfully, while others have not? Whereas much of Western Europe, North America and East Asia
                        have experienced economic development, much of Africa has not. Latin America, Eastern Europe and
                        Eurasia are hybrids, with both pockets of success and failure. While defining what success or
                        failure may mean in light of globalization, our collective focus will be on how best to
                        understand such differences.
